____TURFER____

IDEA:

My idea for this capstone project is to build a web application called TURFER which is used for booking TURF (indoor playground). This application will allow users to search for available turfs, view details such as location, equipments, pricing, and user reviews, and make reservations. Users can create accounts, manage bookings. Turf owners can list their facilities, manage availability, and view booking history. User authentication, and a user-friendly interface. By streamlining the booking process, this application aims to enhance convenience for both turf owners and sports enthusiasts, ultimately aiming for a more organized and enjoyable playing experience.

PLAN:

Day 1:
I plan to work on the user authentication(Signup, login, logout)

Day 2:
	My plan is to work on the data base management and schema validation.

Day 3:
I plan to work on the front-end part my creating necessary state s and UI.
